CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
Project #1

due: Thursday, 3/12/15 at midnight

Create a side-scroller game as a WebGL application. You may work on this project in teams of two.

Objectives:
  -Use 2D polygons to make an interesting game
  -This game should have a scoring system and win condition
  -The player must interact with the game to score
  -The game should last for roughly three minutes
  
Some Examples:
  -Galaga
  -Helicoptor

Requirements:
1. vertex coordinates are not in the default range - a (non identity) Model-View matrix is required.
2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel
3. three files are required in the solution: project1.html, project1.js and project1.README.txt. The 
project1.README.txt file will contain your name(s) and the date along with a brief description of your 
game. Be sure to include complete details of how to interact with your game, the scoring system, and
how to win. As before, all files should contain a comment including your name(s) and date.
